Description: MLmorph integrates morphological modeling with machine learning to 
    support structured decision-making (e.g., in management and consulting). The package 
    enumerates a morphospace of feasible configurations and uses random forests 
    to estimate class probabilities over that space, bridging deductive model 
    exploration with empirical validation. It includes utilities for factorizing 
    inputs, model training, morphospace construction, and an interactive Shiny app 
    for scenario exploration.
